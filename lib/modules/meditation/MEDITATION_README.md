# Meditation & Relaxation Module

## Overview
The Meditation Module guides users in establishing calming pre-sleep routines through meditation, breathwork, and relaxation techniques. Regular practice reduces sleep onset time and improves overall sleep quality by calming the nervous system.

## Core Principle
**Mental relaxation prepares the body for sleep.** Evening meditation and relaxation techniques activate the parasympathetic nervous system, reduce cortisol levels, and create ideal conditions for restful sleep. Consistent practice strengthens the sleep onset response.
