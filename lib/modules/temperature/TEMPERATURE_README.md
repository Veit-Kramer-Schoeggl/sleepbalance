# Temperature Module

## Overview
The Temperature Module guides users in using temperature exposure (cold and heat) strategically to enhance sleep quality, boost energy, and support overall health. Temperature timing has significant effects on alertness and sleep readiness.

## Core Principle
**Temperature exposure at the right time influences circadian rhythm and sleep quality.** Cold exposure in the morning increases alertness and metabolism, while heat exposure in the evening promotes relaxation and facilitates sleep onset through subsequent body cooling.

## Key Features

### Standard Mode (Default)
- **Morning cold exposure**:
  - Timing: ~30 minutes after waking
  - Duration: 2-5 minutes recommended
  - Type: Cold shower
- Push notification reminder at optimal time
- Simple completion tracking
- Evidence-based default settings

### Advanced Mode (Customizable)
- **Dual exposure types**:
  - **Cold**: Cold showers, ice baths, cold plunges, outdoor cold exposure
  - **Heat**: Hot showers, saunas, hot baths, hot tubs
- **Flexible scheduling**:
  - Multiple sessions per day
  - Custom timing for each session
  - Duration and intensity preferences
  - Temperature ranges where applicable
- **Visual time slider** with guidance:
  - **Green (Morning)**: Optimal for cold exposure
  - **Yellow (Midday)**: Neutral, heat exposure acceptable
  - **Orange (Afternoon)**: Good for moderate heat exposure
  - **Light Green (Evening)**: Optimal for heat exposure (2-4 hours before bed)
  - **Red (Late Evening)**: Avoid strong cold exposure
  - **Dark Red (Night)**: Avoid any extreme temperatures

## Temperature Intervention Types

### Cold Exposure
- **Methods**:
  - Cold shower (most accessible)
  - Ice bath
  - Cold plunge
  - Outdoor cold exposure
  - Cryotherapy (advanced)
- **Intensity Levels**:
  - Mild: Cool water (15-20°C)
  - Moderate: Cold water (10-15°C)
  - Intense: Very cold water (<10°C)
- **Best Timing**: Morning (strongest alertness effect)
- **Duration**: 2-10 minutes typically

### Heat Exposure
- **Methods**:
  - Hot shower
  - Sauna (dry or infrared)
  - Hot bath
  - Hot tub
  - Steam room
- **Intensity Levels**:
  - Mild: Warm bath (37-39°C)
  - Moderate: Hot shower (40-42°C)
  - Intense: Sauna (60-90°C)
- **Best Timing**: Evening (2-4 hours before bed)
- **Duration**: 10-30 minutes typically

## Visual Interface
- **Timeline view** displaying:
  - 24-hour schedule
  - Planned temperature interventions
  - Optimal timing zones
  - Color-coded recommendations
  - User's sleep/wake times
- **Session details** showing:
  - Exposure type (cold/heat)
  - Method used
  - Duration and intensity
  - Scheduled vs actual time
  - Completion status

## Notifications
- **Session reminders**: Alert at optimal intervention times
- **Preparation prompts**: Advance warning for sessions requiring setup (filling bath, etc.)
- **Safety reminders**: Duration limits and gradual adaptation advice
- **Module-level override**: Temperature notifications independent of global settings

## Integration with Sleep Data
- Uses **wake time** for optimal morning cold exposure timing
- Uses **bed time** for proper evening heat exposure spacing
- Tracks adherence and correlates with sleep quality
- Monitors energy levels and daytime performance
- Adjusts recommendations based on individual response

## Educational Component
- Explains thermogenesis and circadian effects
- Teaches proper cold/heat exposure techniques
- Provides safety guidelines and contraindications
- Shows research on temperature therapy and sleep
- Displays personalized effectiveness data

## Activity Tracking
- Log completion of scheduled sessions
- Record actual temperature/intensity
- Track duration and method used
- Note subjective experience (energy, relaxation, etc.)
- Monitor progression and adaptation over time

## Safety Features
- **Contraindication warnings**:
  - Cardiovascular conditions
  - Pregnancy
  - Cold urticaria
  - Raynaud's syndrome
  - Other medical conditions
- **Gradual progression guidance**: Start mild, increase intensity slowly
- **Duration limits**: Maximum safe exposure times
- **Emergency information**: When to stop and seek help

## Use Cases
1. **Morning Energizer**: Quick cold shower to boost alertness
2. **Athletic Recovery**: Alternating cold/heat for muscle recovery
3. **Sleep Optimizer**: Evening sauna followed by cool-down
4. **Stress Management**: Regular heat exposure for relaxation
5. **Metabolic Health**: Cold exposure for brown fat activation
6. **Custom Protocol**: Complex schedule for advanced users

## Benefits for Sleep
- Improves circadian rhythm entrainment
- Facilitates sleep onset through evening heat exposure
- Enhances deep sleep percentage
- Increases morning alertness (reducing sleep inertia)
- Supports melatonin production timing
- Reduces stress and anxiety

## Physiological Mechanisms
- **Cold Exposure**:
  - Increases norepinephrine (alertness)
  - Activates brown adipose tissue
  - Reduces inflammation
  - Strengthens circadian amplitude
- **Heat Exposure**:
  - Triggers core temperature drop after session
  - Promotes relaxation and stress relief
  - Facilitates sleep onset
  - Improves cardiovascular function

## Progression Guidelines
- **Week 1-2**: Establish tolerance, minimal duration
- **Week 3-4**: Increase duration gradually
- **Week 5+**: Optimize timing and intensity based on response
- **Advanced**: Experiment with contrast therapy (alternating cold/heat)

## Future Enhancements
- Wearable integration for actual body temperature tracking
- Smart home integration (automated bath/shower timing)
- Guided protocols for specific goals
- Community challenges and group accountability
- Integration with exercise module for recovery optimization
