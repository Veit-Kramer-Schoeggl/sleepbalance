# Light Therapy Module

## Overview
The Light Therapy Module helps users optimize their light exposure throughout the day to support healthy circadian rhythms and improve sleep quality. Proper light timing is one of the most powerful tools for regulating the sleep-wake cycle.

## Core Principle
**Light is the primary regulator of circadian rhythm.** Bright light in the morning advances the sleep-wake cycle and promotes alertness, while avoiding bright light in the evening supports natural melatonin production and prepares the body for sleep.

## Key Features

### Standard Mode (Default)
- **Single morning light session**:
  - Timing: 15-30 minutes after wake time
  - Duration: 15-30 minutes
  - Type: Bright light (sunlight or light box)
- Push notification reminder at scheduled time
- Simple on/off tracking (did you do it?)
- Zero configuration required - works out of the box

### Advanced Mode (Customizable)
- **Multiple light sessions** throughout the day
- **Different light types**:
  - Natural sunlight (outdoor exposure)
  - Light box therapy (10,000 lux)
  - Blue light therapy (specific wavelength)
  - Red light therapy (evening-friendly)
  - Other therapeutic lights
- **Time-specific scheduling**:
  - Set individual times for each light session
  - Duration control per session
  - Intensity levels where applicable
- **Visual time slider** with color-coded guidance:
  - **Green**: Morning hours (optimal for bright light)
  - **Yellow**: Midday (neutral)
  - **Orange to Red**: Evening hours (avoid bright light)
  - **Dark Red**: Nighttime (strong avoidance of bright light)
- Different color coding for red light therapy (less restrictive timing)

## Visual Interface
- **Interactive timeline** showing:
  - 24-hour day cycle
  - User's sleep period
  - Scheduled light sessions
  - Optimal time zones for different light types
  - Color gradient guiding best practices
- **Session cards** displaying:
  - Light type and duration
  - Scheduled time
  - Completion status
  - Quick edit/adjust options

## Notifications
- **Session reminders**: Alert when it's time for light therapy
- **Evening warnings**: Optional reminders to avoid bright screens before bed
- **Blue blocker reminders**: Prompt to use blue-blocking glasses in evening
- **Module-level override**: Light notifications can be enabled/disabled independently of global settings
- **Permission handling**: App requests notification permission and explains importance for optimal use

## Integration with Sleep Data
- Uses user's **wake time** to calculate optimal morning light timing
- Adjusts recommendations based on user's **sleep quality trends**
- Tracks light therapy adherence for correlation analysis
- Can adjust timing automatically based on sleep onset patterns

## Educational Component
- Explains circadian rhythm and light's role
- Teaches difference between light types and their effects
- Provides research-based guidance on timing
- Shows personalized correlations between light exposure and sleep

## Activity Tracking
- Log completion of scheduled sessions
- Record actual duration and timing
- Track light type used
- Note environmental factors (weather, location)
- Optional notes for unusual circumstances

## Light Type Specifications

### Morning/Daytime Light
- **Natural Sunlight**: Best option, outdoor exposure
- **Light Box**: 10,000 lux indoor alternative
- **Blue Light**: Targeted wavelength therapy

### Evening/Night Light
- **Red Light**: Minimal circadian disruption
- **Dim Warm Light**: General recommendation
- **Amber/Orange**: Screen alternatives

## Use Cases
1. **Basic User**: Morning light box for 20 minutes - uses default setting
2. **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)**: Extended morning sessions with light box
3. **Shift Worker**: Custom timing for non-standard sleep schedule
4. **Optimization Enthusiast**: Multiple sessions with different light types throughout day
5. **Evening Screen User**: Red light therapy and blue blocker reminders

## Benefits for Sleep
- Strengthens circadian rhythm timing
- Improves sleep onset (faster falling asleep)
- Enhances sleep quality and depth
- Increases daytime alertness
- Reduces seasonal affective symptoms
- Helps maintain consistent sleep-wake schedule

## Safety Considerations
- Warnings about light sensitivity conditions
- Guidance on safe light box distance and duration
- Eye health reminders (no staring directly at light source)
- Consultation recommendations for medical conditions

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with wearable light sensors
- Automatic outdoor light detection (via location/weather)
- Smart home integration (automated light adjustments)
- Personalized intensity recommendations based on response
- Social scheduling (coordinate with family/partner)
