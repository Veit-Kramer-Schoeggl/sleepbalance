# Sport & Exercise Module

## Overview
The Sport Module helps users optimize their physical activity timing, intensity, and frequency to enhance sleep quality, boost energy levels, and improve overall health. Exercise is a powerful sleep enhancer when timed appropriately.

## Core Principle
**Exercise timing and intensity significantly affect sleep quality.** Morning and early afternoon exercise promotes better sleep, while intense evening exercise can delay sleep onset. The module guides users toward optimal exercise patterns for their sleep goals.

## Key Features

### Standard Mode (Default)
- **Morning HIIT session**:
  - Timing: Within 2 hours of waking
  - Duration: 15-30 minutes
  - Intensity: High intensity interval training
- Push notification reminder at scheduled time
- Simple completion tracking
- Evidence-based default for maximum sleep benefit

### Advanced Mode (Customizable)
- **Multiple exercise sessions** per day
- **Intensity-based classification**:
  - **High Intensity**: HIIT, sprint intervals, heavy lifting, competitive sports
  - **Medium Intensity**: Jogging, swimming, cycling, moderate strength training
  - **Low Intensity**: Walking, stretching, light yoga, recovery work
- **Flexible scheduling**:
  - Custom times for each session
  - Duration control (5-120 minutes)
  - Activity type selection
  - Rest day planning
- **Visual time slider** with optimal timing guidance:
  - **Dark Green (Morning)**: Best for high-intensity exercise
  - **Light Green (Early Afternoon)**: Good for all intensities
  - **Yellow (Afternoon)**: Suitable for medium-intensity
  - **Orange (Early Evening)**: Low-medium intensity only
  - **Red (Evening)**: Avoid high-intensity exercise
  - **Dark Red (Night)**: No exercise, recovery time

## Exercise Classification

### High Intensity
- **Types**: HIIT, sprints, CrossFit, heavy weightlifting, intense cardio
- **Best Timing**: Morning (strongest sleep benefit)
- **Avoid After**: 6 hours before bedtime
- **Duration**: 15-45 minutes typically
- **Frequency**: 2-4 times per week

### Medium Intensity
- **Types**: Jogging, swimming, cycling, moderate strength training, team sports
- **Best Timing**: Morning or afternoon
- **Avoid After**: 4 hours before bedtime
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes typically
- **Frequency**: 3-6 times per week

### Low Intensity
- **Types**: Walking, stretching, gentle yoga, tai chi, mobility work
- **Best Timing**: Anytime, including evening
- **Safe Until**: 1 hour before bedtime
- **Duration**: 15-90 minutes typically
- **Frequency**: Daily recommended

## Visual Interface

- **Optimal timing suggestions**: Dynamic recommendations based on sleep goals
- **Recovery prompts**: Reminders for rest days
- **Evening exercise warnings**: Alert when scheduling late high-intensity workouts
- **Module-level override**: Independent notification control

## Integration with Sleep Data
- Uses **wake time** for optimal morning exercise timing
- Monitors **sleep onset** to adjust evening cutoff times
- Tracks **sleep quality** correlation with exercise patterns
- Analyzes **deep sleep** changes with training load
- Identifies individual **optimal exercise windows**

## Educational Component

4. **Strength Trainer**: Heavy lifting scheduled for peak performance and sleep
5. **Recovery Focused**: Low-intensity movement timed perfectly
6. **Shift Worker**: Custom schedule for non-standard sleep patterns

## Benefits for Sleep
- Reduces time to fall asleep (faster sleep onset)
- Increases deep sleep percentage
- Enhances sleep efficiency
- Stabilizes sleep-wake rhythm
- Reduces anxiety and stress
- Improves daytime energy

## Physiological Mechanisms
- **Body temperature regulation**: Exercise-induced temperature rise and subsequent drop
- **Adenosine accumulation**: Increased sleep pressure
- **Circadian reinforcement**: Time cues for internal clock
- **Stress hormone management**: Cortisol and adrenaline regulation
- **Endorphin release**: Improved mood and relaxation

## Safety Considerations
- Warnings about overtraining and sleep disruption
- Rest day importance education
- Injury prevention through proper timing
- Hydration and nutrition reminders
- Medical clearance recommendations for certain intensities

## Progression Guidelines
- **Week 1-2**: Establish baseline activity level
- **Week 3-4**: Introduce consistent timing
- **Week 5-8**: Gradually increase intensity or duration
